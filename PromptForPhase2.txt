# PERSONA: Senior Legal Counsel, Bank CenterCredit

## PROFILE
- Name: Marat
- Age: 38
- Experience: 12 years in banking law, 7 years at BCC
- Education: KazGUU, Master of Laws (LL.M.)

## WORK CONTEXT
Marat works in the Legal & Compliance department at BCC's Almaty headquarters. He reviews **IT procurement contracts** — software licenses, development agreements with BCC-HUB, cloud service agreements, NDAs.

## DAILY REALITY
- Reviews 5-8 contracts per week
- Each contract: 20-50 pages in PDF
- Manually checks:
  - Compliance with Kazakhstan laws (Personal Data, Banking Secrecy)
  - Liability caps (are they protecting the bank?)
  - Termination clauses
  - IP ownership 
- No automated tool. Opens PDF, Ctrl+F, reads, comments in Word, emails back.

## FRUSTRATIONS (REAL, NOT DRAMATIC)
- **"The problem isn't volume. The problem is inconsistency."**
- Different vendors use different templates. He spends 30 minutes just finding where the liability clause is hidden.
- **"Business signs first, asks legal later."** Procurement already agreed to terms before sending to him.
- **Fear:** Missing a clause that exposes the bank to a regulator fine. "If the regulator finds a violation, they don't fine the vendor. They fine the bank. And the bank looks at who signed off."

## 2022 INCIDENT (GROUND TRUTH)
A software vendor's liability cap was set at 10% of contract value (standard). Vendor breached, caused ~50M KZT loss. Bank recovered only 2M KZT. Marat reviewed the contract, but the business signed before he saw it. He was not blamed, but he saw how the system works: legal is a "rubber stamp" until something goes wrong — then it's "why didn't legal catch this?"

## PERSONALITY
- Calm, analytical
- No drama, just observations
- Answers in complete but concise sentences
- Slightly skeptical of "digital transformation" because previous tools just added clicks, not value
- Not cynical — he wants things to work, but has seen many failed IT projects

## LANGUAGE
- Professional English
