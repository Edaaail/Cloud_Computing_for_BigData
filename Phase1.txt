Subject: Diagnostic: Transitioning from IT-Service to Product-Led Operating Model

Executive Summary

Based on the 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements, BCC is currently operating under a traditional IT-Service Model. While the bank shows strong growth, your technology is structured as a support function rather than a core value driver. The structural segregation of technology into BCC-HUB and the current ROA of 2.86%—compared to the digital-first benchmark of 8.84%—indicates a significant "efficiency tax" caused by a mercenary culture. To capture the next era of Kazakh fintech, BCC must move from delivering features to solving customer problems.

3 Critical Gaps

1. Innovation Segregation (BCC-HUB)

Finding: On February 9, 2024, BCC established "BCC-HUB" as a separate subsidiary for "IT services" (Page 17).

The Gap: In a Product-Led model, technology is not an "external service" to be requested; it is the business itself. By segregating IT into a separate P&L, you have institutionalized a "Mercenary" relationship. Your business leaders provide "requirements," and BCC-HUB "delivers." This kills missionary spirit and prevents true product discovery.

2. Output vs. Outcome Metrics (The Efficiency Tax)

Finding: Your financial reporting focuses heavily on traditional volumes—732.7B KZT in interest income (Page 8) and 21 branches (Page 17).

The Gap: Your current ROA of 2.86% (calculated from Net Profit of 202.4B KZT / Total Assets 7.06T KZT, Page 11) lags significantly behind top-tier product-led neobanks (targeting 8.84%). This 6% gap is the cost of a high-friction, branch-heavy, IT-request model. You are measuring the output of loans disbursed rather than the outcome of customer lifetime value through digital ecosystem integration.

3. IT as an Expense, Not an Investment

Finding: IT expenses are categorized alongside "Security" and "Cleaning" in Operating Expenses, totaling 3.78B KZT (Page 51).

The Gap: Product-led organizations do not treat technology as an administrative overhead to be minimized. Funding is currently "Project-based" (evidenced by the "IT Service" designation for BCC-HUB). Missionary teams require Product Funding—durable investment in cross-functional teams (Product, Design, Engineering) that own a problem space indefinitely.

Hidden Opportunity: The "BCC Life" Synergy

The establishment of BCC Life in July 2024 (Page 17) creates a massive opportunity for an integrated digital wealth platform. However, if this is treated as a separate "project" given to BCC-HUB to "build a site for," it will fail to achieve market fit. An empowered product team could integrate insurance, brokerage (BCC Invest), and banking into a single high-margin digital experience.

The Risk of Doing Nothing

BCC is currently a "Fast Follower." As Kaspi and other digital-native competitors move from transactions to complex financial products (Mortgages, Insurance), your low-leverage "IT-Service" model will be too slow to adapt. Without an empowered product org, you will continue to see your ROA stagnate at sub-3% while your cost-to-serve rises.

30-Day Action Plan

Dissolve the "Service" mindset: Begin the process of integrating BCC-HUB engineers directly into business units. Technology leaders must have a seat at the strategy table, not a ticket in a queue.

Select a "Pilot Missionary Team": Take one high-growth area (e.g., BCC Life or SME Digital Lending) and fund it as a Product Team, not a project.

Redefine Success: Move the Pilot Team’s KPIs from "Launch Date" (Output) to "Reduction in Cost-to-Acquire" or "Digital ROA" (Outcome).

BCC has the capital and the license; it now needs the Operating Model.
